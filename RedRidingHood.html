    I’m sure you have all heard the fairytale of a little red riding hood. It’s a bedtime classic. Even though you all know how the story goes, just for some clarity this is how the modern version is told.
    <br><br>
    A little girl in a rade cape is told by her
    parents to visit her grandmother and on the way, she meets a wolf that has intentions to eat her. The wolf finds out where the little red riding hood is going and races there before her. When Young Red Riding Hood goes to see her grandmother, she
    discovers that a wolf has devoured the old lady whole and is now planning to eat the little girl as well. In some versions of the story, the grandmother is locked in a closet instead. Now a woodchopper rushes in for the rescue and saves little
    red riding hood and her grandmother by killing the wolf.
    <br><br>
    Although this is the tale told in modern times, Little Red Riding Hood story dates back several years and has been modified every generation. Jamie Tehrani, an anthropologist at Durham
    University has been researching the mystery of this tale. His research showed that Folktales are not unlike biological species and evolve as they are told and retold with slight alterations to each one. Tehrani used a method called phylogenetics
    to find the original tale.
    <br><br>
    It was thought that Charles Perrault and the Grimm brothers invented the tale in the 17th century, but research has shown that it has an origin that dates further back. There have been many theories as to which tale is
    the original, despite it being impossible to tell. There is an 11th-century Belgium poem that resembles the tale of Little Red Riding Hood. This tale was told by local peasants and recorded by a priest. A popular theory is that the tale
    originated in China and as it spread it was divided into two tales; “The Wolf and the Kids” and “Little Red Riding Hood”. Although the fact that they split into two tales is true, the tale did not originate in China as the Asian tale resembles
    the more modern story instead of the ancestral variants. The story of the WOlf and Kids is the following. A nanny goat advises her children not to open the door for anyone when she leaves them at home. What she doesn't realise is that a wolf is
    lurking outside the home, listening in on her conversation. The wolf comes to the door and pretends to be the nanny goat while she is out. When he enters, he devours all of the children. The nanny goat chases him down, kills him, and slices open
    his belly to rescue her children at the end of the story. This story has appealed to so many cultures and generations due to its metaphorical meaning of the wolf. It teaches a very important lesson in life that not everyone is who they seem to be
    and may have different intentions than what they show.

  <p class="blur textthings">
    Little Red Cap
    Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm
    Once upon a time there was a sweet little girl. Everyone who saw her liked her, but most of all her grandmother, who did not know what to give the child next. Once she gave her a little cap made of red velvet. Because it suited her so well, and
    she wanted to wear it all the time, she came to be known as Little Red Cap.
    One day her mother said to her, "Come Little Red Cap. Here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine. Take them to your grandmother. She is sick and weak, and they will do her well. Mind your manners and give her my greetings. Behave yourself on
    the way, and do not leave the path, or you might fall down and break the glass, and then there will be nothing for your sick grandmother."
    <br><br>
    Little Red Cap promised to obey her mother. The grandmother lived out in the woods, a half hour from the village. When Little Red Cap entered the woods a wolf came up to her. She did not know what a wicked animal he was, and was not afraid of
    him.
    <br><br>
    "Good day to you, Little Red Cap."
    <br><br>
    "Thank you, wolf."
    <br><br>
    "Where are you going so early, Little Red Cap?"
    <br><br>
    "To grandmother's."
    <br><br>
    "And what are you carrying under your apron?"
    <br><br>
    "Grandmother is sick and weak, and I am taking her some cake and wine. We baked yesterday, and they should give her strength."
    <br><br>
    "Little Red Cap, just where does your grandmother live?"
    <br><br>
    "Her house is a good quarter hour from here in the woods, under the three large oak trees. There's a hedge of hazel bushes there. You must know the place," said Little Red Cap.
    <br><br>
    The wolf thought to himself, "Now there is a tasty bite for me. Just how are you going to catch her?" Then he said, "Listen, Little Red Cap, haven't you seen the beautiful flowers that are blossoming in the woods? Why don't you go and take a
    look? And I don't believe you can hear how beautifully the birds are singing. You are walking along as though you were on your way to school in the village. It is very beautiful in the woods."
    <br><br>
    Little Red Cap opened her eyes and saw the sunlight breaking through the trees and how the ground was covered with beautiful flowers. She thought, "If a take a bouquet to grandmother, she will be very pleased. Anyway, it is still early, and I'll
    be home on time." And she ran off into the woods looking for flowers. Each time she picked one she thought that she could see an even more beautiful one a little way off, and she ran after it, going further and further into the woods. But the
    wolf ran straight to the grandmother's house and knocked on the door.
    <br><br>
    "Who's there?"
    <br><br>
    "Little Red Cap. I'm bringing you some cake and wine. Open the door for me."
    <br><br>
    "Just press the latch," called out the grandmother. "I'm too weak to get up."
    <br><br>
    The wolf pressed the latch, and the door opened. He stepped inside, went straight to the grandmother's bed, and ate her up. Then he took her clothes, put them on, and put her cap on his head. He got into her bed and pulled the curtains shut.
    <br><br>
    Little Red Cap had run after flowers, and did not continue on her way to grandmother's until she had gathered all that she could carry. When she arrived, she found, to her surprise, that the door was open. She walked into the parlor, and
    everything looked so strange that she thought, "Oh, my God, why am I so afraid? I usually like it at grandmother's." Then she went to the bed and pulled back the curtains. Grandmother was lying there with her cap pulled down over her face and
    looking very strange.
    <br><br>
    "Oh, grandmother, what big ears you have!"
    <br><br>
    "All the better to hear you with."
    <br><br>
    "Oh, grandmother, what big eyes you have!"
    <br><br>
    "All the better to see you with."
    <br><br>
    "Oh, grandmother, what big hands you have!"
    <br><br>
    "All the better to grab you with!"
    <br><br>
    "Oh, grandmother, what a horribly big mouth you have!"
    <br><br>
    "All the better to eat you with!" And with that he jumped out of bed, jumped on top of poor Little Red Cap, and ate her up. As soon as the wolf had finished this tasty bite, he climbed back into bed, fell asleep, and began to snore very loudly.
    <br><br>
    A huntsman was just passing by. He thought it strange that the old woman was snoring so loudly, so he decided to take a look. He stepped inside, and in the bed there lay the wolf that he had been hunting for such a long time. "He has eaten the
    grandmother, but perhaps she still can be saved. I won't shoot him," thought the huntsman. So he took a pair of scissors and cut open his belly.
    <br><br>
    He had cut only a few strokes when he saw the red cap shining through. He cut a little more, and the girl jumped out and cried, "Oh, I was so frightened! It was so dark inside the wolf's body!"
    <br><br>
    And then the grandmother came out alive as well. Then Little Red Cap fetched some large heavy stones. They filled the wolf's body with them, and when he woke up and tried to run away, the stones were so heavy that he fell down dead.
    <br><br>
    The three of them were happy. The huntsman took the wolf's pelt. The grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine that Little Red Cap had brought. And Little Red Cap thought to herself, "As long as I live, I will never leave the path and run off
    into the woods by myself if mother tells me not to."
